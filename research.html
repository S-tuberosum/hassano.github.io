							<p>Studying if strong electric fields can localize electrons both with and without interactions. The study is based on exact diagonalizations. The number entropy is the indicator for localization, which is bounded in a localized system while it grows without bounds in a metal.</p>

							<p>The Electron Ion Collider (EIC) houses the dual-radiator Ring Imaging Cherenkov (dRICH) detector, this detector is the focus of my thesis. Cherenkov detectors produce rings with different radii subject to the speed of the particle. The problem here is to identify different particle types using deep learning.</p>
							<p>This problem lends itself quite nicely to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as it is a visual problem. PyTorch for Python was used with MinkowskiEngine for sparse convolutions and pooling. The average accuracy of the model was best for electrons (~98%) and pions (~95%), followed by kaons (~81%) and then protons (~6%). The full thesis can be found <a href="documents/Thesis_Dissertation.pdf">here</a> alongside the <a href="https://github.com/ohassn/Particle-Identication-Using-CNNs">code</a> for more information on the project and the results.</p>

							<p>SuperKEKB is an electron-positron collider located in Tsukuba, Japan. It is the successor to KEKB and is home to the Belle II experiment, which aims to study the properties of B mesons. There's been a proposal of upgrading the accelerator to include polarized electron beams, the primary motivation behind polarized electron beams at SuperKEKB is to allow for precision electroweak physics at the accelerator. This would be particularly powerful due to SuperKEKB's record high luminosities. SuperKEKB requires measurements which leave the beamline stable, Compton polarimetry allows us to measure the polarization while keeping the electron beam unaffected, although this comes at the expense of the precision of the measurement.</pr>
							<p>The main goal of the research was to simulate the inclusion of a Compton polarimeter in the high energy ring (HER) of the accelerator. A Compton event generator was used to generate our events, acting as an input for DD4hep. The optimal position for the detectors was studied, alongside the ideal beampipe width and material.</p>
